# Connect Four - Mini Project UE22CS151A

1. Welcome to my project on the classic strategy game, Connect Four.
2. Connect Four is a two-player strategy game that has a 6x7 grid and each
player is given 21 coins of a colour (Red and Yellow respectively).
3. The players take alternate turns to play and the goal is to connect four coins
of the same colour vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
4. During his/her turn, the player can select the column in which he wishes to
place the coin, and the coin gets placed in the bottommost empty slot in the
selected column.
5. The player who connects four coins of his colour first wins the game.
